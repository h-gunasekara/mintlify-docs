This guide explains how to structure your requests to the Catalog Feed API, including how to use filters and pagination. All requests follow a consistent format to make integration straightforward for AI shopping agents.

## HTTP Method and Endpoint

All requests to the Catalog Feed API use the POST method and should be sent to:

```
POST https://catalogai.vercel.app/api/feed
```

## Headers

Every request must include these headers:

| Header | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Indicates that the request body is in JSON format |
| `x-api-key` | `YOUR_VALID_API_KEY` | Your unique API key for authentication |

## Request Body

The request body must be a JSON object with the required parameters:

```json Basic Request Body
{
  "vendor": "Vendorname",
  "page": 1
}
```

### Request Parameters

Parameters are passed directly in the root of the JSON request body.

<ResponseField name="vendor" type="string" required>
  Filter feed results by vendor name (case-insensitive partial match). Only products matching this vendor pattern will be included.
  
  **Example:** `"Saintlaurent"` would match products from the Saint Laurent vendor.

  <Info>
    Vendor names are derived from the URL site name (domain) with capitalization. For example, `https://www.jennikayne.com/` corresponds to the vendor name `Jennikayne`.
  </Info>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="page" type="number" required>
  The page number (1-indexed) for pagination. The API returns a fixed number of products per page (10 items per page).
  
  **Example:** `2`

  <Note>
    Page numbers are 1-indexed, meaning the first page is page 1 (not 0).
  </Note>
</ResponseField>

## Example Requests

### Basic Required Request

<CodeGroup>
```json Minimum Required Request
{
  "vendor": "Saintlaurent",
  "page": 1
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Requesting a Specific Page

<CodeGroup>
```json Request (Page 2)
{
  "vendor": "Saintlaurent",
  "page": 2
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Request Validation

The API performs validation on your request:

- `vendor` is required and must be a string. It's recommended to use the capitalized site name (domain without TLD).
  - **Example:** For `https://www.jennikayne.com/`, use `"Jennikayne"`
- `page` is required and must be a positive integer.

If validation fails, you'll receive an appropriate error response with details about the issue. See the [Response Structure](/developer-guide/feed/response-structure) guide for error formats.
