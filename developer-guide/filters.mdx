# Filtering Products

The Catalog API provides powerful filtering capabilities to help you narrow down product results. This guide explains all available filter options and how to use them effectively.

## Filter Structure

Filters are passed in the `filters` object of your request body:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 20.00,
    "price_max": 50.00,
    "vendor": "EcoWear",
    "is_available": true,
    "attributes": {
      "color": "Red",
      "fabric": {
        "cotton": true,
        "polyester": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

<Note>
  All specified filters are combined using AND logic. A product must match ALL specified filter criteria to be included in the results.
</Note>

## Available Filters

### Price Filters

Filter products based on their price:

<ResponseField name="price_min" type="number" optional>
  Minimum price (inclusive). Products with a price less than this value will be excluded.
  
  **Example:** `25.99`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="price_max" type="number" optional>
  Maximum price (inclusive). Products with a price greater than this value will be excluded.
  
  **Example:** `99.99`
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup>
```json Example - Price Range
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 25.99,
    "price_max": 99.99
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Vendor Filter

Filter products by vendor or brand:

<ResponseField name="vendor" type="string" optional>
  The vendor name (exact match). Only products from this vendor will be included.
  
  **Example:** `"Palace"` or `"Nike"`
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup>
```json Example - Vendor Filter
{
  "filters": {
    "vendor": "Palace"
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Availability Filter

Filter products by availability status:

<ResponseField name="is_available" type="boolean" optional>
  Product availability. Set to `true` to include only available products, or `false` to include only unavailable products.
  
  **Example:** `true`
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup>
```json Example - Available Products Only
{
  "filters": {
    "is_available": true
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Attribute Filters

Filter by product attributes using the `attributes` object:

<ResponseField name="attributes" type="object" optional>
  Object containing attribute-specific filters.
</ResponseField>

#### Color Attribute

<ResponseField name="attributes.color" type="string" optional>
  Filter by a specific color (exact match).
  
  **Example:** `"Red"` or `"Navy Blue"`
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup>
```json Example - Color Filter
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "color": "Red"
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

#### Fabric Attribute

<ResponseField name="attributes.fabric" type="object" optional>
  Filter by fabric types. Keys are fabric names, and values must be `true` to include that fabric.
  
  **Example:** `{"cotton": true, "linen": true}`
</ResponseField>

<CodeGroup>
```json Example - Fabric Filter
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "fabric": {
        "cotton": true,
        "linen": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  For the fabric filter, products will match if they contain ANY of the specified fabrics (OR logic between fabric types).
</Note>

## Combining Filters

You can combine multiple filters for precise results:

<CodeGroup>
```json Example - Combined Filters
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 20.00,
    "price_max": 100.00,
    "is_available": true,
    "attributes": {
      "color": "Blue",
      "fabric": {
        "cotton": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

The above example would return:
- Products priced between $20 and $100 (inclusive)
- Products that are currently available
- Products that are blue in color
- Products made with cotton fabric

## Filter Precedence

When using both the `query` parameter and explicit filters:

1. The API first extracts any implicit filters from the query
2. Your explicit filters always take precedence over implicit filters
3. If the same filter is specified both implicitly (in the query) and explicitly (in the filters object), the explicit value is used

## Example Use Cases

### Price Range Products

<CodeGroup>
```json Budget-Friendly Products
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 0,
    "price_max": 30.00
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Premium Products from a Specific Brand

<CodeGroup>
```json Premium Brand Products
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 100.00,
    "vendor": "Balenciaga",
    "is_available": true
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

### Products with Specific Materials

<CodeGroup>
```json Eco-Friendly Materials
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "fabric": {
        "organic cotton": true,
        "recycled polyester": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</CodeGroup>
