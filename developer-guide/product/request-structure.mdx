This guide shows you how to request detailed information about a specific product using its URL.

## Basic Request

Send a POST request to:
```
POST https://catalogai.vercel.app/api/product
```

### Headers
| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `x-api-key` | `YOUR_API_KEY` |

### Request Body
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.saintlaurent.com/en-us/leather-jackets/classic-biker-jacket-in-black-leather-633218Y5YA21000.html"
}
```

## Parameters

<ResponseField name="url" type="string" required>
  The complete product page URL you want to get information about.
  
  **Example:** `"https://www.ganni.com/en-gb/recycled-wool-knitwear-k1628-943.html"`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="enableAI" type="boolean" optional>
  Whether to use AI to enhance product descriptions. Defaults to `true`.
  
  **Example:** `false`
</ResponseField>

## Example Requests

### Get Product Information
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.cos.com/en_usd/women/knitwear/product.oversized-cashmere-sweater-brown.1188535001.html"
}
```

### Get Product Without AI Enhancement
```json
{
  "url": "https://www.balenciaga.com/en-us/hourglass-small-bag-black-671285VB35N1000.html",
  "enableAI": false
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Search Database**: First checks if the product is already in our database
2. **Extract from Website**: If not found, extracts product data from the website
3. **Enhance with AI**: Improves descriptions and categorization (if enabled)
4. **Return Results**: Sends back the complete product information

## Response Format

You'll get back either:
- **Success**: Complete product details including title, price, images, and variants
- **Not Found**: Empty result if the product couldn't be found or extracted

<Note>
The API works with most major fashion and retail websites. If a product isn't found, make sure the URL is correct and points to a valid product page.
