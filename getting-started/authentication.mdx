# Authentication

All requests to the Catalog API must include a valid API key for authentication. This key ensures that only authorized applications can access your product data.



## Security Best Practices

To keep your API key secure:

<Check>
  Store your API key in environment variables or a secure configuration system
</Check>

<Check>
  Never hardcode your API key directly in client-side code where it could be exposed
</Check>

<Check>
  If building a public-facing application, proxy API requests through your own backend
</Check>

<Check>
  Rotate your API key periodically for enhanced security
</Check>

<Warning>
  If you suspect your API key has been compromised, contact us immediately to have it revoked and replaced.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

If you make a request without a valid API key, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Missing or invalid API key"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API usage is subject to rate limits based on your specific plan. Rate limit information is included in the response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per period
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the rate limit will reset

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
