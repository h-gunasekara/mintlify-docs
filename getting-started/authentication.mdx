# Authentication

All requests to the Catalog API must include a valid API key for authentication. This key ensures that only authorized applications can access your product data.

## API Key Authentication

The API uses a simple key-based authentication system. You must include your API key in the `x-api-key` header with every request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogai.vercel.app/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_VALID_API_KEY" \
  -d '{ "query": "t-shirt" }'
```

<Tip>
  Replace `YOUR_VALID_API_KEY` with the actual API key provided to you by our team.
</Tip>

## Obtaining an API Key

To get an API key:

1. [Contact our support team](/support/contact) to request access to the Catalog API
2. Once approved, you'll receive your unique API key
3. Store this key securely and do not share it publicly

## Security Best Practices

To keep your API key secure:

<Check>
  Store your API key in environment variables or a secure configuration system
</Check>

<Check>
  Never hardcode your API key directly in client-side code where it could be exposed
</Check>

<Check>
  If building a public-facing application, proxy API requests through your own backend
</Check>

<Check>
  Rotate your API key periodically for enhanced security
</Check>

<Warning>
  If you suspect your API key has been compromised, contact us immediately to have it revoked and replaced.
</Warning>

## Error Handling

If you make a request without a valid API key, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Missing or invalid API key"
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API usage is subject to rate limits based on your specific plan. Rate limit information is included in the response headers:

- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Total requests allowed per period
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in the current period
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Timestamp when the rate limit will reset

If you exceed your rate limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
