# Product Features

The Catalog API offers a comprehensive set of features designed to enhance your e-commerce application's search and discovery capabilities. Here's a detailed breakdown of what our API can do:

## Natural Language Search

<Accordion title="Smart Query Processing">
  Transform natural language queries into powerful search parameters. The API understands phrases like "under $50" or "blue cotton shirts" and automatically converts them into the appropriate filters.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Synonym Expansion">
  Automatically expand search terms to include relevant synonyms. For example, a search for "pants" will also match "trousers" and "bottoms", increasing result relevance and coverage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Implicit Filter Detection">
  Extracts implied filters from natural language queries, such as price ranges, colors, and materials, without requiring explicit filter parameters.
</Accordion>

## Advanced Filtering
