# Introduction

The Catalog API is a powerful solution designed for retrieving product data from your catalog with advanced search and filtering capabilities. Built specifically for e-commerce and commerce applications, it enables you to create rich, intelligent shopping experiences for your customers.

## What You Can Do

With the Catalog API, you can:

- **Perform full-text searches** across your product catalog with natural language support
- **Apply various filters** based on product attributes, pricing, availability, and more
- **Retrieve paginated results** for efficient loading and display
- **Leverage smart query features** like synonym expansion and implicit filter detection

## Key Concepts

### Smart Search

The API's search functionality goes beyond simple keyword matching. When you provide a natural language query, the system:

1. Extracts implicit filters from the query (e.g., price constraints, colors, fabric types)
2. Expands the query with synonyms to capture a wider range of relevant products
3. Intelligently combines these elements to deliver accurate, relevant results

### Flexible Filtering

The API provides a comprehensive filtering system that allows you to:

- Set price ranges with minimum and maximum bounds
- Filter by specific vendors
- Check product availability
- Target specific product attributes like color and fabric
- Combine multiple filters with AND logic for precise results

### Pagination

The API supports pagination to efficiently manage large result sets, allowing you to:

- Control which page of results to retrieve
- Get metadata about total result counts and page information
- Optimize your application's performance and user experience
