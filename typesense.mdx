# Typesense Integration

The Product Catalog API is powered by [Typesense](https://typesense.org/), a modern, open-source search engine designed for speed and developer experience. This page explains how our Typesense integration works and how to get the most out of its powerful search capabilities.

## What is Typesense?

Typesense is a fast, typo-tolerant search engine optimized for search-as-you-type experiences and instantaneous search results. Unlike traditional search engines, Typesense provides:

- **Speed**: Search results in milliseconds
- **Typo Tolerance**: Automatic handling of misspellings and typos
- **Ranking**: Intelligent ranking of results based on multiple factors
- **Faceting**: Dynamic categorization of results
- **Simple API**: RESTful JSON API with clear semantics

## How We Use Typesense

Our Catalog API leverages Typesense for:

1. **Full-Text Search**: Searching across product titles, descriptions, and attributes
2. **Filtering**: Fast faceted searches and filtering on multiple criteria
3. **Typo Tolerance**: Handling misspellings and variations of product terms
4. **Ranking**: Smart relevance-based ordering of search results

## Search Schema

Our Typesense collection has the following schema for products:

```json
{
  "name": "products",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "id", "type": "int32"},
    {"name": "title", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "description", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "vendor", "type": "string", "facet": true},
    {"name": "url", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "is_available", "type": "bool", "facet": true},
    {"name": "price_value", "type": "float"},
    {"name": "price_display", "type": "float"},
    {"name": "price_currency", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "attributes.color", "type": "string", "facet": true},
    {"name": "attributes.category", "type": "string", "facet": true},
    {"name": "attributes.fabric.*", "type": "bool", "facet": true}
  ],
  "default_sorting_field": "price_value"
}
```

## Search Parameter Mapping

When you make a request to our API, we map your parameters to Typesense search parameters:

| API Parameter | Typesense Parameter | Description |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------|
| `query` | `q` | The search query text |
| `filters.vendor` | `filter_by` | Filter expression for vendor |
| `filters.price_min` | `filter_by` | Range filter for minimum price |
| `filters.price_max` | `filter_by` | Range filter for maximum price |
| `filters.is_available` | `filter_by` | Boolean filter for availability |
| `filters.attributes.*` | `filter_by` | Filters for various product attributes |
| `page` and `limit` | `page` and `per_page` | Pagination parameters |

## Performance Optimization

To maximize performance when working with our Typesense-powered API:

1. **Use Filters**: Combine text search with filters for faster, more precise results
2. **Pagination**: Always use pagination to limit result set size
3. **Focused Queries**: More specific queries perform better than generic ones
4. **Faceting**: Let the API handle faceting rather than doing it client-side

## Advanced Typesense Features

While our API abstracts away many Typesense details, it's useful to know that our implementation supports:

1. **Prefix Searching**: As users type, we match prefixes for instant search
2. **Fuzzy Search**: Automatic typo correction (e.g., "coton" matches "cotton")
3. **Field Weighting**: Title matches are weighted higher than description matches
4. **Hybrid Ranking**: Results balance exact matches and semantic relevance

## Behind the Scenes

When you make a search request, we:

1. Parse your query and filters
2. Construct an optimized Typesense search request
3. Execute the search against our indexed product database
4. Format and return the results

This process typically completes in under 50ms, allowing for near-instantaneous search experiences in your applications.

## Limitations

While Typesense provides powerful search capabilities, be aware of these limitations:

1. **Result Count Cap**: Total item counts are capped at 50 for performance reasons
2. **Complex Boolean Logic**: The API simplifies filters to basic AND/OR conditions
3. **Highlighting**: Text highlighting is not currently supported
4. **Geo Search**: Geographic search capabilities are not implemented
