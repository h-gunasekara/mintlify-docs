# Smart Search Features

The Catalog API is powered by Typesense, a modern search engine that provides advanced full-text search capabilities. This guide explains how the search functionality works and how to get the most out of it.

## Basic Search

To perform a basic search, simply include a `query` parameter in your request:

```json
{
  "query": "cotton shirt"
}
```

This will search across multiple fields, including:
- Product title
- Product description
- Vendor
- Product attributes

## How Search Works

When you provide a search query, the API performs several steps to ensure relevant results:

1. **Tokenization**: The query is split into individual tokens (words)
2. **Field Weighting**: Matches in the title are given more importance than matches in the description
3. **Exact and Fuzzy Matching**: Both exact matches and slight variations (for typo tolerance) are considered
4. **Relevance Scoring**: Results are ranked based on a combination of factors, including match quality and field importance

## Free-Text Search Advantages

Our search implementation offers several advantages:

1. **Natural Language Processing**: Users can search using natural language (e.g., "blue cotton shirt")
2. **Typo Tolerance**: Slight spelling mistakes are automatically corrected (e.g., "coton shirt" will match "cotton shirt")
3. **Relevant Ranking**: Results are ranked by relevance, with the most likely matches appearing first

## Using Wildcards and Prefixes

Typesense automatically handles prefix search, so if a user types "cott", products with "cotton" will match. You don't need to add wildcards explicitly.

## Combining Search with Filters

For the most effective results, combine search queries with filters:

```json
{
  "query": "cotton shirt",
  "filters": {
    "price_max": 50.00,
    "is_available": true
  }
}
```

This approach gives you the best of both worlds:
- The flexibility and natural language understanding of full-text search
- The precision of structured filtering

## Search Field Coverage

The search is performed across the following fields:

- `title`: Product title
- `description`: Product description
- `vendor`: Product vendor/brand name
- `attributes.*`: All attributes, including:
  - `attributes.color`
  - `attributes.fabric`
  - `attributes.category`

## Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Be Specific**: More specific search terms generally yield more relevant results.

2. **Consider Search Terms**: Think about how users might search for products and what terms they might use.

3. **Use the Right Tool for the Job**: For exact matches on specific fields (like price), use filters instead of including them in the search query.

## Analyzing Search Relevance

If your search results don't seem to match expectations:

1. Check if your search terms match the actual data. For example, searching for "polyester" won't match products that only mention "poly" in their description.

2. Consider using broader terms if specific terms aren't finding matches.

3. Remember that the API uses relevance ranking, so products with more matching fields or exact matches will appear higher in results.

## Pagination with Search

When using search with pagination, remember that the `page` parameter starts from 1:

```json
{
  "query": "cotton shirt",
  "page": 2  // Gets the second page of results
}
```

The response includes metadata about the total number of matching items and pages:

```json
{
  "products": [...],
  "meta": {
    "totalItems": 25,
    "totalPages": 3,
    "currentPage": 2,
    "pageSize": 10
  }
}
```

<Note>
  The `totalItems` value is capped at 50, regardless of the actual total. This is to optimize performance for large result sets.
