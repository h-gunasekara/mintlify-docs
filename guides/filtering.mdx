# Filtering Products

The Catalog API provides powerful filtering capabilities to help you narrow down product results based on various criteria. This guide explains how to use filters effectively in your API requests.

## Filter Structure

All filters are specified in the `filters` object in your request body:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    // Your filters go here
  }
}
```

## Top-Level Filters

The following filters can be applied at the top level of the `filters` object:

### Price Range Filtering

Filter products by price range using `price_min` and `price_max`:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 20.00,  // Minimum price (inclusive)
    "price_max": 50.00   // Maximum price (inclusive)
  }
}
```

You can use either one or both parameters to create open-ended or bounded price ranges.

### Vendor Filtering

Filter products by a specific vendor:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "vendor": "EcoWear"  // Single vendor (exact match)
  }
}
```

Or filter by multiple vendors:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "vendor": ["EcoWear", "TrailBlazer", "Organica"]  // Match any of these vendors
  }
}
```

### Availability Filtering

Filter products by availability:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "is_available": true  // Only show available products
  }
}
```

## Attribute Filters

The `attributes` object allows filtering based on product characteristics:

### Color Filtering

Filter by a specific color:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "color": "Blue"  // Single color (exact match)
    }
  }
}
```

Or filter by multiple colors:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "color": ["Blue", "Green", "Red"]  // Match any of these colors
    }
  }
}
```

### Fabric Filtering

Filter by fabric types:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "fabric": ["cotton", "linen", "organic_cotton"]  // Match any of these fabrics
    }
  }
}
```

### Category Filtering

Filter by product category:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "attributes": {
      "category": "Men > T-Shirts"  // Category (exact match)
    }
  }
}
```

## Combining Filters

You can combine multiple filters to create complex queries. All filters are applied with AND logic, meaning products must match ALL specified criteria:

```json
{
  "filters": {
    "price_min": 20.00,
    "price_max": 100.00,
    "vendor": "EcoWear",
    "is_available": true,
    "attributes": {
      "color": "Blue",
      "fabric": ["cotton", "organic_cotton"],
      "category": "Men > T-Shirts"
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, only products that:
- Cost between $20 and $100
- Are from the vendor "EcoWear"
- Are available
- Are Blue
- Contain either cotton or organic cotton
- Are in the "Men > T-Shirts" category

will be returned in the response.

## Combining Filters with Search

Filters can be combined with the `query` parameter to create hybrid search-and-filter requests:

```json
{
  "query": "organic shirt",
  "filters": {
    "price_max": 50.00,
    "is_available": true
  }
}
```

This will perform a text search for products matching "organic shirt" while also applying the price and availability filters.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Use Specific Filters**: More specific filters help the search engine narrow down results more efficiently.

2. **Combine with Search**: When possible, use both the `query` parameter and filters together for better relevance.

3. **Filter Arrays**: When filtering with arrays of values (like multiple vendors or colors), keep the arrays reasonably sized for better performance.

## Troubleshooting

If you're not getting the expected results:

1. **Check Format**: Ensure your filter values match the expected format. For example, price values should be numbers, not strings.

2. **Check Field Names**: Verify that you're using the correct field names. All field names are case-sensitive.

3. **Verify Data**: Make sure the values you're filtering by actually exist in the database. For example, if you filter by a color that no products have, you'll get zero results.
