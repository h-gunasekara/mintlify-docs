# Authentication

The Catalog API uses API keys to authenticate requests. All API requests must include a valid API key in the request headers.

## API Keys

Your API key carries many privileges, so be sure to keep it secure. Do not share your key in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub, client-side code, or social media.

## Including Your API Key in Requests

All requests to the API must include your API key in the `x-api-key` header:

```bash
curl -X POST https://catalogai.vercel.app/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "query": "cotton shirt"
  }'
```

## API Key Verification

When you make a request with your API key, our server performs the following steps:

1. Check if the `x-api-key` header is present
2. Verify the key exists in our database
3. Check if the key is active and has the necessary permissions
4. Associate your request with your user account for any usage limits or analytics

## Error Responses

If you do not include an API key or your key is invalid, you will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": "API key required (x-api-key header)"
}
```

Or:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid API key"
}
```

## Getting an API Key

To get an API key for the Catalog API:

1. Sign up for an account at [dashboard.example.com](https://dashboard.example.com)
2. Navigate to the API Keys section in your account dashboard
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Give your key a name (e.g., "Development", "Production")
5. Select the appropriate permissions
6. Copy and securely store your new API key

<Note>
  API keys are only displayed once at creation time. If you lose your key, you'll need to generate a new one.
</Note>

## Key Security Best Practices

- Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories
- Use environment variables to store your API key in your applications
- Implement proper secrets management for production environments
- Rotate your API keys periodically to minimize risk
- Create separate API keys for different applications or environments
