---

The Agentic Search Mini endpoint provides fast, intelligent product discovery using Google Shopping data enhanced with AI-powered attribute analysis. This lightweight endpoint is optimized for speed while still providing detailed product attributes through optional AI enrichment.

## When to use Agentic Search Mini

Use this endpoint when you need:
- **Fast product discovery** with sub-second response times
- **Limited result set** of up to 10 high-quality products
- **AI-powered attribute enrichment** for detailed product analysis
- **Google Shopping integration** for current product availability

For larger result sets or more comprehensive search capabilities, consider using the [full Agentic Search endpoint](/api-reference/endpoints/search/agentic-search) instead.

## How to authenticate requests

<ParamField header="x-api-key" type="string" required>
  Your API key for authentication. [Get your API key](mailto:founders@getcatalog.ai) if you don't have one yet.
</ParamField>

## What parameters can you send?

<ParamField body="query" type="string" required>
  Natural language search query for product discovery
  
  **Examples:**
  - `"sustainable midi dresses"`
  - `"luxury minimalist handbags"`
  - `"versatile blazers for work"`
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="enable_enrichment" type="boolean" default="true">
  Enable AI-powered product attribute enrichment for enhanced product data analysis. Set to `false` for faster response times if detailed attributes are not needed.
  
  **When to disable enrichment:**
  - You need the fastest possible response times
  - You only need basic product information (title, price, URL)
  - You're building a real-time autocomplete feature
  
  **When to enable enrichment (default):**
  - You need detailed product attributes (color, material, features)
  - You're building product comparison tools
  - You need rich product data for AI-powered recommendations
</ParamField>
